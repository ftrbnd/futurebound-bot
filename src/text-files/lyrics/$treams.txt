heart beat
blunt feel
cant sleep
cold but its still burning
your precious time wasting on me
so why you gotta drag me
ive been in a hole since like last week
and im holding on
ive held on
im holed up

cos you love in
streams
seasonal life bringer
cos you love in
streams
but i cant keep swimming uphill

wonder how well call it in the light
saharan heat had me driving in the sky
throwing stones cos youre getting bored
kids in glass houses dont wear a lot of clothes
ok so why you gotta drag me
ive been in a hole since like last week
and im holding up
ive held on
im holding on

cos you love in streams
you love in streams
cos you love in streams
you love in streams
but i cant keep swimming uphill
cos you love in
you love in streams
oh the only way is up from here

heat beats drowned out
let me go now
blunt feel trauma
sleepless cycle
precess further
