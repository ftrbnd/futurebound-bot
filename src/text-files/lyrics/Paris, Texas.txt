i dont want to second guess it
all my life
i dont want to second guess it
all my life

but in my dreams im in love still baby
took damage she aint call
he said fuck that bitch
she aint wanna dance
paris, france got me low

if i could colour grade all of my evenings 
blood in the sky call it healing
ersatz we was cool for the moment
whiplash we were driving on the phone and
we cant always make right and i feel it
long way back on my feet
no shoulder to lean on
heartbreak like a themesong

i been keeping it top of my mind
london be kind
i donâ€™t have nothing to hide
taking your word like messiah
still ran some crimes
ah, real life comes
whether you ready or not
fuck with me now
ah, i let her down
spent all my life on a spark
and falling asleep in the dark
and dream of no losses

feeling the burn in my arm
keeping my foot to the floor
lightspeed as florida blurs
and pointing my lens at the stars
im gonna see them regardless
them boys dont care bout no karma
i thank the world for the help
but i break my heart by myself

i break my 
i break my heart by my
i break my heart by my
i dont want to second guess it
all my life

if i could colour grade all of my evenings 
blood in the sky call it healing
ersatz we was cool for the moment
whiplash we were driving on the phone and
we cant always make right and i feel it
long road back for a villain
if i walk that arc til it feels right
would it feel right

but in my dreams im in love still baby
took damage she aint call
he said fuck that bitch she aint wanna dance
paris, france got me low
