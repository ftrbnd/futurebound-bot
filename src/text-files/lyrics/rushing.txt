rushing in and rushing out again
another martyr anon
so you can wake up and start again
from stardust to god
and maybe in another mans life
on another mans time
maybe the times just not right for us
maybe this is all that we are

the lives ive loved
too close to know
the hindsight song
theres no way id rather wait than know

the highs we trade for the lows
just gotta wake up and start again
cos this is no place like home
and if you couldve stayed there you wouldve
couldve, shouldve
another life i had known
maybe the time would be right for us
but this is all that we got
our luck

the lives ive loved
too close to know
chasing but at what cost?
just cos theres no way id rather wait than know?
