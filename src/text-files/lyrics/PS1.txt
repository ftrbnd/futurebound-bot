second hand smoke, fucking up my chest
like you as you are, can you air my text?
i feel out of time, closing in on space
you been in my head and not paying any rent
i got two more lives, i got seven spent
i found missing time, spending it
but it wont talk to me
how can i bridge the lie to who you are?
if its how you are, its true
id follow you down -
always down when you are
i love when you push it back
i miss how you used to talk back
and talk shit with me
 
so i keep staying up all night
killing back some time
i keep thoughts of you
thought loops
whatever i want
am i still what it is you like?
ill see you round some time
blue ticks, im a red light
confused how to get right
only come through
when im better off without it
i dont want to be in love
i dont want to be in love no more
 
dipping ps1 just to catch up on you
you been m.i.a., but you text no different
i feel levels up and you dont know, dont care
for old times sake, its human nature
feel it deep but shallow embraces 
dual sim
said she phoning it in
im not convinced
know some day some under paid
karma gon come collect
come out with it dont hold back
things tend to balance through the madness
fact is i heard that you been
 
staying up all night
revenge killing some time
still i keep thoughts of you
thoughts can do
whatever i want
am i still what it is you like?
see you all the time
blue tick, youre a red light
confused how to get right
only come through when im better off without it
i dont want to be in love
i dont want to be in love no more
