take it slow, take it slow
i dont know, i don't know
i dont know, i don't know

your smile over FaceTime
cant tell if youre looking at me
or at yourself
or at yourself
days are moving fast now
time i thought we had to burn
just slipped away
slipped away

i just want to see your body like a creep
love it when i see those eyes look up at me
make an mp4 something that i can feel
now its like youre beside me even when you leave
in and out of consciousness and a dream
always on my mind just saying how I feel
i just want you on my team

my baby its a rush
like new ink under my skin
youre never coming off
dont care if they notice
im locked in
locked in
locked in
locked into your love
locked into your love
locked in
locked in
locked in
locked

take it slow, take it slow
i dont know, i don't know
i dont know, i don't know
i dont know, i don't know

and i just want to see your body like a creep
love it when i see those eyes look up at me
make an mp4 something that i can feel
now its like youre beside me even when you leave
in and out of consciousness and a dream
always on my mind just saying how I feel
dont you want to be on my team

my baby its a rush
like new ink under my skin
youre never coming off
dont care if they notice
im locked in
locked in
locked in
locked into your love
locked into your love
locked
