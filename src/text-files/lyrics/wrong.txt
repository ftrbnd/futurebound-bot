but i could be more
isnt there more?
dont you dream of forgetting this?
have we forgotten what we want?
counting the wars
and broken bones

havent we lost enough already?
isnt this more than what its worth?
have we forgotten where we came from?

long way from laying in the dirt
and if i can only dream of up from down there
god help me ill be gone

have i lost sight of everything ive worked for?
did i get this all wrong?
