free fall for now
desert air wont drown you out
and for a second i thought the world was ending
and i couldnt breathe in
and so this isnt your time
been chasing kairos with those scapegoat eyes
cant you realise
fuck the summertime its you
so scared of overgrowing youth
when its not done with you

and everybody gon run
everybody gon run
and you can call it what you want
but i call it moving on
and im so done
with singing words i dont believe in no more

so what you rushing for
who said its now or never?
i think youre taking on the wrong advice
but its alright if these are your worst times
you know youre good
youre good

and if you want you can breathe on your own
this isnt what i thought but its beautiful
make peace with your mistakes and theyll turn to gold
weightless i let go

and everybody gon run
everybody gon run
and you can call it what you want
but i call it moving on
and im so done
with singing words i dont believe in no more

call it what you want but i call it growing up
and im done
