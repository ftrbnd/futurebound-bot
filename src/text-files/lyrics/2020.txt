she says im no good with my hands
but i held up the whole sky for her
i want to forget my future and
jump into the dark
i wouldve caused so much trouble
if id had you to sneak out with me
all our futures melted in your hands
theyre drowning us

still i say things like
no hindsight in 2020
got my sight checked thats precious to me
cant blindside me im well aware
if you were me id burn this out
to the sound of the daylight slipping from me
all our yesterdays spent misguided, sliding
and now our heels worn down, and self aware
with dreams of stopping

you must have me messed up
with somebody else
you got me mixed up
you got me stressed out
youth spent plaited under walls
waterfalls
walls can talk
to things like

no hindsight in 2020
got my sight checked thats precious to me
cant blindside me im well aware if
you were me id burn this out
to the sound of the daylight slipping from me
all our yesterdays spent misguided sliding
and now our heels worn down and self aware
with dreams of stopping
dreams worth stopping for
