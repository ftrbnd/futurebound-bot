reflections
of my dash aligning stars over shoulder
inflections
tell me you dont really mean what you say

that you were in love! love! love!
youre screaming and bursting heads
breathing corrupted air
your cigarettes going out dear

mayfair and lip fillers
heartbreak and coke dealers
you were in love! love! love!

but since youre on your way out
living fast i capsize amazed now
leave a message when you go

i had a dream that you wanted me
i still see you with my eyes closed
i dont think you understand how brilliant you burned

does your past feel complete now im here?
versions of another version youve seen
when i calm down
ill be long gone
