and we looked like a slasher film
playing out of sequence
baby its just feedback
looping up my demons
told them if im gonna die its with you
but you were like the breeze when its one hundred three
felt like if we dont sleep then tomorrows just a dream
oh i hope they dont find us tonight

if time could stand still
if i could change
maybe id have found the words
to tell me to tell you to say
i could have stayed here forever

and we look like a slasher film
cut up out of sequence
running from a crime scene
baby im still bleeding
and i can never go back
i just want you to know that
ive been staring at the ceiling
looking for a breach
even in the silence i can hear you say
the ends just seconds away

but if time could stand still
if i could change
maybe id have found the words
to tell you that

i feel like i could puke my guts up
if they werent already on the floor
i feel like im losing grip on and on
and you can grab my hand as we run off
maybe well make it after dawn
but in the sunlight well be different

if time could stand still
if i could change
and maybe id have found the words
to tell you to tell you to say
i could have stayed here forever
