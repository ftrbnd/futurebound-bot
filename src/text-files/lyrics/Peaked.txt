dancing on my own
my feet are drawn to you
and lost at every sound
my heart cant fade it

mama said why you gotta waste my time?
i threw it to the wind, no line
its something that i need no crime
the call cant reconnect this time
the substances we craved subsided
i never want to live half sided no

but still i persist on
i feel like were orphaned
my halo got all bent
i hate how i feel and
im not falling
but i say nothing

no i cant believe you wanted me
i can not see the lining here
i fall asleep to sounds of dreams of you
youre losing me
dont lose me
dont lose grip on me
feelings down on me
heart beatdown on me

staring at the screen but i feel no way
bleeding through to real life fucking up the wave
i can make you feel but could never make you stay
what do you want from me?
what do i hope to see?
i havent been home in weeks

still i can feel loved for now
and i can accept the paths ive taken
and if all this dies out ill be good
still im down and

dancing on my own
my feet are drawn to you
and lost at every sound
my heart cant fade it
