i met the devil in the hills last night
i was driving by myself, alone
he said boy what you running from?
i said i dont know

i dont know if it was a better time
but girl we were giants then
endless nights we were infinite
summers end would mean the death of us

but summer past
and we grew up
and all of our paths
they split up
and i havent seen your face or heard your voice in so long
so so long
we had a good run
its over now

lying on the grass talk is so old
living under orion we grew so bold
lying on our days we were outlaws
our loss but
catch me if you can
never wiped out
trying to catch a wave
trying to break out
i guess i didnt know

and now im gone
but it dont hurt me anymore
thats just the way it goes
yeah i shouldve known
but i heard you talking through the walls late last night
there are no ends just grays and half-lives
half time
its alright

that summer past
and we grew up
and all of our plans
they split us up
and i havent seen your face or heard your voice in so long
so so long
we had a good run
its over now

so please dont fade me out
so please dont lose me now

i heard the words that you never said
smoke screen from a cigarette
exhale we can never be whats in our heads
elevation doesnt matter now its straight ahead
sending shivers down my spine, life pirouettes
its cool, were used to losing real friends
only ever feeling it in retrospect
and we were really breathing not silhouettes
maybe in another dream this would never end

cos everything is not alright
and we are falling
but thats just life without some lows there is no highs
and everything will be ok
though we are all hurting
cos time flies fast and you know no pain is forever

ever
