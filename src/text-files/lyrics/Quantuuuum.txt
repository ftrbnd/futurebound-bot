i got a lot on my neck tonight
she want to crush until my atoms gone
if i could disappear id do it tonight
nothing surprises anymore its fucked

and i think you know
i think you know
i cant help it
And i think you know
i think you know
it don't matter

i got a map of my favourite cuts
nothing can stop them from decaying away
i saw her text him from the crook of my arm
i still agree when they say were all the same

and i think he knows
i think he knows
and cant help it
and i think he knows
i think he knows
it don't matter
matter

it don't matter

that this aint working out
and i cant tell what's real
seconds counting down
its all painless in the end

and i think you know
i think you know
it don't matter
and i think you know
i think you know
ah 

kiss me through the phone
ive been waiting on you all my life
kill me through the phone 
ive been waiting on it
my whole life
