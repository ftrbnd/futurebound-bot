speaking of another life
rooftop convos 
backstory of tattoos 
i can't imagine
eye contact fast
high hopes got dashed 
when you called me up 

i cant believe my luck
the ghost i loves in love with someone else
and he doesnt know about us
and now its fading away

i feel something
its fading away

can i make you see
you belong with me
dont you know
youre throwing it away
throwing it away
throwing it
cant i make you see 
you belong with me
dont you know
youre throwing it away
throwing it away
throwing it
sometimes when I feel
what it does to me
i just want to throw it all away
throwing it away 
throwing it
throwing it away
throwing it away
throwing it
throwing it away
throwing it away
throwing it

gun hands in the air 
slow motion
got me feeling something strange 
its a cold ocean
ahadadream showing me new ways
i had a dream there was no escape
you got me back in your own ways
i ate that karma
now the debts paid
eye for an eye
we saw each other change
orbits we had
decoupled, in decay
then a couple years
showed me new sides of familiar faces
we fell out of touch
out of sync it chafed
fell on my face
hit you for commiserations
the t-shirt said
the heart had changed

those texts made me a ghost in the shell

how can i make you see
you belong with me
dont you know
youre throwing it away
throwing it away
throwing it
cant i make you see 
you belong with me
dont you know
youre throwing it away
throwing it away
throwing it
sometimes when I feel
what it does to me
i just want to throw it all away
throwing it away 
throwing it
throwing it away
throwing it away
throwing it
throwing it away
throwing it away
throwing it

i feel something
its fading away
its fading away
