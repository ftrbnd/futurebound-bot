i cant see a way through
i cant be myself around you
if im honest
i cant stop myself from thinking
its all over
youre gonna stop crying
and after the end comes whatever
and ever you need me
these songs all loop

touch down
giant leap
heartbreak
godspeed

highlight
headland
edge of the world
fading out

i loved how the sky burned
soaking now, we slip apart
older now i cant tell you and me
apart
i just wanted to let you know
that i burnt when the sky heard
disintegrate and fall apart
running out of time
can never beat the lesser
of idle stress
and all the rest of it
enough to move you

im just scared that youll cut me off

still i loved every second of it!
and i cant have the past
and where im going
said just take the best of all the pieces
and the reasons youre gone
still i see myself in all the people i let go!

older now
i keep pouring over those lives
white lies
holding out how many seconds
till the roof falls in
so ice the hurt
last time enough
forever breaks us up
connotations burnt
into my lexicon
foreign feelings riot
until the past is won
all my friends forgot
but im still holding on
i keep fucking up
my lines get crossed

and you want to die often
how you gonna hide
all those tears from me?
all you wanted
just slipped through changing
times its not the same
im just scared that youll cut me off

still i loved every second of it!
and i cant have the past
and where im going
said just take the best of all the pieces
and the reasons youre gone
still i see myself in all the people i let go!

im just scared that youll let me go
