last night was a car crash
highlights meet a quick end
live the high life 'fore the week ends
coming down hard to the sunset sinking in

didnt try hard for a diehard
nothing i can say that you wont get wrong
and everybody asks where youre gone now
can you only really want
what you dont have enough?
everything you ever wanted adding up
to be the reason you cant stand it now
you talk a lot well act like it
finally found a way to get myself untangled

and undone but its alright
this aint been the dream in a long time
make sure you play the music when my times up
oh just say it im done

so if you loved me how was i supposed to know?
cos now were fading and losing what we wanted most
but in spite of how you feel its not the end of the world
some say these things are for the best
how are you so sure?

and you can find me where the sea pours into the stars
ill get there someday
i hope you find everything you think that you want
bruises will fade
time on our side we can wait for it
ill be doing fine if you are
cos life is but a dream
only as real as you let it be

so if you loved me how was i supposed to know?
and now were fading and losing what we wanted most
but in spite of how you feel its not the end of the world
some say these things are for the best
for better, or worse
