i can feel this dropping
drunk drive and spoke to god
no fear, all that worry
and youre not moving but you want it to stop
day dreamer, #goals screenshotted
high speeds sank the sun
gold dreams of california
so comfortable you need some trouble to cause

but you dont know what you want
so ill let go of control
cos i know just what you are
youre gonna break me in two

i can feel this dropping
and when the wheels dont stop just
run me over
no dialling down now
only realising
were too far forward now
running out of fuel
i wanted you to hold back
falling after something that aint right
i dont feel right
wanted you to know that
you cant hold me

you dont know what you want
so ill let go of control
cos i know just what you are
youre gonna
youre going
going
