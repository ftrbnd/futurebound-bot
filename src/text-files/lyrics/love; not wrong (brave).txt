and i know ive been closing myself off unsure
i know ive been real hard to reach, harder to love
and i know its tiring this shit is getting old
so please just hold on to me
ive slayed these demons theyre old to me
recurring dreams this is happening
tearing my seams; lucid reality

and i just want you to feel love
before it disappears
cos we are more than were not
so never fear to feel
good when every things wrong
and find some beauty there
cos all we ever are is brave

and your worlds not ending

so i wont go
still living in the middle of a one way war
i cant fight it but im trying to be what you want
you cant sing but youre singing this anyway
and anyway
so please just hold on to me
this is no end were not finished here
finding our way were just changing
becoming more than i think of me
yeah
these fears in my head
and dreams in my bed
they wont get the best of me
cos i chase dreams till the end
these nightmares all bend
silver linings are all i need

so please just hold on to me
ive slayed these demons theyre old to me
recurring dreams this is happening
tearing my seams from reality

and i just want you to feel love
before it disappears
cos we are more than were not
so never fear to feel
good when everythings wrong
and find some beauty there
cos all we ever are is brave
