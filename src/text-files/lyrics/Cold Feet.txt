faded along the way
it cant all be on the way
no im falling now dont take what you dont need

belated by the way
its too late the price to pay
its over now dont say what you dont mean

tangled in the backseat
melting through the taxi
calis spinning around me
what was it you said?

feels hollow and i cant speak
always been about me
cant lie to you ive cold feet
waitin on kairos now

cos i can only see so far
staying awake like its a lost cause
and i dont feel the least bit tired
talking to you
you said this aint you but being straight up got bad

faded along the way
it cant all be on the way
dont fall in now dont take what you dont need

belated by the way
its too late the price i pay
though its over now dont say what you dont mean

still we were tangled in the backseat
melting through the taxi
cali was spinning around me
what was it you said?

pressure when you cant see
only think about me
cant lie to you ive cold feet
where does it leave us now?
