i never had the guts to run away
ever since 16
dreaming of a brighter day
out of control and out of everything
you came out the blue
or was it blue gray

felt like waking up
in a new place
that stole the dark from the night
shone a new way

but i can feel your heartbeat rising
even when youre ghost
i can feel your every single movement
so good morning
its a good morning

felt like waking up
in a new place
that stole the dark from the night
shone a new way

but i can feel your heartbeat rising
even when youre ghost
and i can feel your every single move
so good morning
good morning

as day breaks mortality
colours run and bleed
for fear nows the only time there is
and just as good night comes following
follow down and seem
i who watched this disappear

and out of the dark youll find you
given the time and space
the world will bend to guide you

i never had the guts to run away
ever since 16
been dreaming of a brighter day
out of control and after everything
you came out the blue
