cos weve been driving so long
I cant remember how we got here
or how we survived
so long out trying to run from our pride
till you set fire to my atmosphere
and i remember how i spent the 23rd
feeling six feet under when im 30,000ft in the air
chasing that sun down
so far east im west bound
feeling like the edge of the world is near

but youll feel better when you wake up
swear to god ill make up
everything and more when i get back someday
this is more than just a phase love
shooting stars all break up
and even though it seems like half the world away
things will be better in america
heard the streets are gold there
maybe i can fly you out this place someday
chasing dreams like im on novocaine
screaming through your airwaves
looking back i almost thought i heard you say

stay youre not gonna leave me
this place is right where you need to be
and why your words gotta mean so much to them
and they mean nothing to me
so stay youre not what youre hearing
cos ive been watching you changing
and who said youre one in a million anyway?

cos you see only what you want to
your tunnel vision owns your
and you cant see whats wrong
when you keep sleeping through the p.m
eyes wide open when youre dreaming
youre sleepwalking
just keep talking
maybe you can talk your way out of this deep end
no b plan in your system
just tell me what your thinking
im scared that you might fall
but youre not
but youre not

and youll feel better when you wake up
taking off your make up
sun always seems to wash our fears away
and its always shining somewhere
i just gotta get there
and even though it seems like half the world away
things are better in america
heard the streets are gold there
maybe i can fly you out this place some day
chasing dreams like im on novocaine
screaming through your airwaves
looking back i almost thought i heard you say

stay your not gonna leave me
this place is right where you need to be
and why your words gotta mean so much to them
when they mean nothing to me
so stay youre not what youre hearing
cos ive been watching you changing
and who said youre one in a million?

youre so much better than that

stay youre not what youre hearing
cos ive been watching you changing
and who said youre one in a million
anyway?

and youll feel better when you wake up
swear to god ill make up everything and more when i get back some day
chasing dreams like im on novocaine
screaming through your airwaves looking back i almost thought i heard you say

youre so much better than that x
