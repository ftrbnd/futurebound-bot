ill say it once for the bayside
i come alive when the light dies
overcast but were inside
eyes wide
lied twice
my advice dont mean shit tonight
cos ive been driving though i cant see shit and ive
been lying through my teeth just to get the feeling right
and feel alright
so girl just turn the lights down

and too many times ive been caught up when i know better
so i push it back down cos i never want to let out
that ive been dying since i saw you were gone
forget me cos i aint waiting for no one

cos i aint waiting for no one

and ive been trying to dig my way out of the ocean
and punch a hole in the sky
and flood the light through to midnight
and i dont know where youre going
you cant expect the past to repeat with the ending changed
so dont forget where you came from
and we are never alone
drops making waves in the ocean
