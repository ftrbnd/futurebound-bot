waves crashing over me
as light disappeared
touch myself for some dopamine
what a fucking loser
i missed it bad but i hate it here
im out cried
started to phoenix in ashland
facetimed a blaze in slow motion

i watched it collapse in my palms
i been feeling the love i had fall
through open arms
and bleeding out
i wish i made it back you know
we shouldve lasted years
call it fate if it helps you

to let this go
i dont want the things i loved no more
its cutting me up
old friend dont go
i dont want to feel alone no more
it comes and it goes

I saw your eyes in a dream last night
so used to not getting to say goodbye
melting away with the changing light
you know you dont have to stay
ill afterglow in the dark
of course the past can be changed
i watched it bend while i talked
the feelings all interchange
i feel you here when youre gone
and through it all
let it fade if it helps you

to let this go
i dont want the things i loved no more
its cutting me up
old friend dont go
i dont want to feel alone no more
it comes and it goes

howd you like to see the world?
how to hold you when it hurts?
your eyes they drift through hazey light
the cruelty of circumstance and time
i dont want to wake you up
its clear youd rather be elsewhere
id rather be in love
