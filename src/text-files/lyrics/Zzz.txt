last dance are you ready or not
no chance that we make this out alive
i thought we could see a way out in time

but it got so dark
whered the light go
talking so much
save the ozone
saying nothing 
except to tell me
its late

so i wish you sweet dreams
if you want to sleep on me
no tears in the morning
its alright, its alright
its all just sweet dreams
and youre sleeping on me
even though its not real
its alright, its alright

by the time you wake up
im the other side of the river
kept my face dry
dont say you feel different now
its your loss, your loss, your loss
if youre lost 
by the time you wake up
wonder how it got so distant 
summertime skies
feel different without me now
its your loss, your loss, your loss
its your loss, your loss, your loss

dont ask if you dont want to find out
youre so sad when you dont get what you want
so tired of trying to change your mind

comme ci comme ca
feelings come and go
take what you want
feeling no remorse
head on my chest
still so comfortable

so i wish you sweet dreams
if you want to sleep on me
no tears in the morning
its alright, its alright
its all just sweet dreams
and youre sleeping on me
even though its not real
its alright, its alright

by the time you wake up
im the other side for the river
kept my face dry
dont say you feel different now
its your loss, your loss, your loss
if youre lost
by the time you wake up
wonder how it got so distant
summertime skies
feel different without me now
its your loss, your loss, your loss
its your loss, your loss, your loss
