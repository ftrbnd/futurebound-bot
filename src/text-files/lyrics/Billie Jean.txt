she was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
i said dont mind but what do you mean i am the one
she said i am the one

she told me her name was billie jean as she caused a scene
then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one

go on dance
on the floor
in the round

and the people always told me be careful what you do
and dont you go around breaking young girls hearts
my mother always told me be careful who you love
and be careful what you do because the lie becomes the truth

and billie jean is not my lover
shes just a girl who thinks that i am the one
but the kid is not my son
but the kid is not my son

she says i am the one

for forty days and for forty nights
law was on her side
but who can stand when shes in demand
her schemes and plans
so take my strong advice
dont think twice

she told me baby wed danced til three
then she looked at me
she showed me a photo of my baby crying
his eyes looked like mine

go on dance
on the floor
in the round

and people always told me be careful what you do
and dont you go around breaking young girls hearts
and she came and stood right by me
and she smelt the sweet perfume
and this happened much too soon
and she brought me to her room

and billie jean is not my lover
shes just a girl who thinks that i am the one
but the kid is not my son
but the kid is not my son

she says that i am the one
