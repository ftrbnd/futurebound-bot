the morning light shines a lifeline
escape is what i need
i shouldve listened last night girl
this is beyond belief
that we keep falling for the lure of
liquid confidence and lights
and we skydive from walls we built
dying just to feel alive

on the way down screamin
woah
if all we have is time then well be alright
its not much but its better than nothing
were running on fumes but well make it through the night
its not love but its better than dreaming

oh im on fire
theres a burning in my bones
and in my eyes these dreams theyre taking hold
i just need time

building walls to burn them down
canon balls to watch me drown
youve got me lost in here and now
youve got me lost in lost and found
we only hang in evenings
and i dont know what im thinking
but i know that i wont think it
if i keep up with this thinking
all these dreams and all these plans
we shared under the moonlight
theyre dreams and plans that i have
i just dont know if youll fit right
when i leave in the morning
and i kiss you and say goodnight
i kick myself until we kick it
shouldve told you goodbye

coming home so late at night
with clothes covered in sand
i dont know just what im thinking
but im doing what i can
and if all we have is time then we will find

if all we have is time then well be alright
its not much but its better than nothing
were running on fumes but well make it through the night
its not love but its better than dreaming
