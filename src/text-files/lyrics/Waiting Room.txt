oh, i could stay here for some time
open pandoras box and scroll a while
flash cuts through rave like lightning strike
hate losing my cool, love losing my mind

tears in the booth, if it was pyrrhic i could never tell
when i dream of you do you see me as well?

(if they dont really care, i dont really want to know)
carry versions of you every single where i go
waiting on a world that was never gonna show
but i dont want to get stuck in my ways
i havent seen the stars in so long

i dont want to get stuck in my ways

havent seen the stars in so long
