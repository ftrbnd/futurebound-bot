i cant find you
but cant fault you
cos i can get so caught up in my own head

you just float through
i cant catch you
and i can understand
but cant face the feeling
that im just another end

so when you coming home?
i could be what you need girl if you want me to
you know what they say bruh that love gon come back to you

but i can float too
and i dont ask for much from you
and maybe thats too much too soon
so i keep rolling through the blackout
no fire without some fallout
made peace out of the pieces
not i cant take it back now no
but i keep on track now up
and yeah thats all of it
i gave up my youth for this
cos i wanted it and
if you think that i need you then youre out of your head
but i want you

so bring me down
and drown me out
ill be waiting here when youre ready
and ill lay me down unfinished now

so when you coming home?
i could be what you need girl if you want me to
you know what they say bruh that love gon come back to you
come back to you
come back to you
oh its always you
gon come back to you
come back to you
gon come back to you
come back to you

so bring me down
and drown me out
ill be waiting here when youre ready
and ill lay me down

unfinished

when you coming home?
i could be what you need girl if you want me to
if you let me
you know what they say bruh that love gon come back to you
