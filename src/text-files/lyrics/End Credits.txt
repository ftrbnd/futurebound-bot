cigarette ash like wildfire
burning holes in the nighttime
open scars cut like barbed wire
white lies flying high like a ceasefire
dropping flags on the shoreline
this is as far as i can feel right
cos what you dont know
can haunt you

and all we ever wanted
was sunlight and honesty
highlights to want to repeat
lets get away from here and
live like the movies do
i wont mind when its over
at least i didnt think for a while

so lets run
make a great escape
and ill be waiting outside for the getaway
it doesnt matter who we are
well keep running through the dark
and all well ever need is another day
we can slow down cos tomorrow is a mile away
and live like shooting stars
cos happy endings hardest to fake

sunsets on power lines
making a break for the otherside
heading out to where that sunshine
45 millimeter rolling like we lost time
polaroids and outcast
rather burnout young than grow up fast
and we could be forever futurebound
cos all i need is time and now and i could leave this past behind me
and maybe ill see a way for me to stay
when theres so much out there
so ill live forgetting for the time being
[and all we ever wanted]
[was sunlight and honesty]
[highlights to want to repeat]
[lets get away from here and]
[live like the movies do]
and i wont mind when its over
at least i didnt think for a while
so lets run
make a great escapeand ill be waiting outside for the getaway
it doesnt matter who we are
well keep running through the dark
and all well ever need is another day
we can slow down cos tomorrow is a mile away
and live like shooting stars
cos everything was never the same

and i want to let you know
i want to let you go
but i just cant bring myself to speak
but this is how it goes
the end credits the roll
this bridge was built over kerosine
but we can watch it
[burn down]
[we can watch it burn down]

and all i ever wanted
was sunlight and honesty
highlights to want to repeat
lets get away from here and
live like the movies do
i wont mind when its over
at least i didnt think

so lets run
make a great escape
and ill be waiting outside for the getaway
it doesnt matter who we are
well keep running through the dark
and all well ever need is another day
we can slow down cos tomorrow is a mile away
and live like shooting stars
cos you can wish away forever but youll never find a thing like today
