how could you be so careless?
i sweat this i swear
i think im losing my voice
i took no time to take care

i smashed my phone but honestly
i feel relieved you cant reach me
now i can exhale on my own

what were you thinking? that night was a dream
at the top of your lungs ive heard you scream in your sleep
and i know you dont mean a thing
i just get lost in translation
so how much is enough gonna take?

i got a number for you
i call it breaking
i got a lover baby
dont need what youre giving me
more than what you think
oh love aint love if it aint rough
but your screaming

ive said it all
i thought maybe youd believe me cos i dont
these days its a cliche i know
i have no words

and if i could forget you you know i would leave
i cant help myself from feeling all this is wasted on me
and i love the rain but i cant live in a storm
ive got more to come
still learning to grow

what were you thinking? that night was a dream
at the top of your lungs i hear you screaming no sleep
and i know you dont mean a thing
i just get lost in translation
so how much is enough gonna take?
i got a lifetime to wait
seconds cant bury me
