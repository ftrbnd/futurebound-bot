i just want to be where you are
i dont want this feeling to stop
but if heaven has other plans
i would still make a run for it

riding round town with your hands on me
i see you with my eyes closed constantly
but i dont need this shit to make sense
i dont really care when it feels like this now 

dropping
wifi problems
didnt want a link on my arm
but she gorgeous
FaceTime calling
iPhone 5c
keep the flash on
eyes glowing in the darkness

now im riding round town with my thoughts on you
just want to hear you say its all you think of too
and i dont need shit to make sense
i dont really care when it feel like this 

gggiiiiirrrrlllll
i just want to be where you are
i dont want this feeling to stop
but if heaven has other plans
we could still make a run for it
girl
i just want to be where you are
i dont want this feeling to stop
but if heaven has other plans
i would still make a run for it
if it all looks lost in the end
i would still make a run for it

heaven knows I can

idk idk
fuck it here we go
Romeo

whats the rush
she said im dying to be in your arms
just want to be where you are
