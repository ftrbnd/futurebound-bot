i couldnt wait to leave that town
it broke my heart
i had to go
i made a choice
to see this out i lost it all
you didnt show
all you wanted was some violent form of love
immolate me
all i was looking for was colours blurred
and words that id forget
and now im singing

slow down
keep those feet on the ground
i hope youll be home soon
somehow
well figure out how to cope
this nothing we cant
there is nothing we cant do right

you lost your voice you couldnt sing
you couldnt talk about it
i stood and watched
the summer shone rain down our backs
we didnt care
it was enough
all you wanted was some violent form of love
immolate me
all i was looking for was colours blurred
and nights thatd id forget
and now im singing

slow down
keep your feet on the ground
i hope ill be home soon
somehow
we figured out how to cope
this is nothing we cant
there is nothing we cant do
right?
