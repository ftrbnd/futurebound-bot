theres a hole in the world
now i can hear your voice like youre beside me
and i can see your face like youre in front of me
but youre out of reach 
5g send me 
send me
places that i cant be
 
in a moment its over 
but theres some things i wish i didnt see
and theres some ways i wish i didnt feel
and theres some waves that towered over me 
not sure how im still standing here
but the musics good
and i know its late, ah

if you want to go just say
no end for me in sight
not sure how many more ways i can say
that youre the only thing i think about
but i feel it under conversation
sometimes its not what its not
sometimes its not what its not
 
crying over stirring the water
the sky ate her up
the weight of the world on my shoulder blades
dont stray too far
and these nights alone wont be the only ones
and these dark nights arent the only ones
still cant tell if im strong enough
i take refuge in arms of love
and bury my face in my friend

i came so close to the end 
saved or destroyed in a moment 
light sleeper waking again 
change in my plans 
said if none of this shit
makes more sense in the end
ill be pissed

some things i know you don't show
i let you in and you let it run cold
i saw your face say that i should forget it
and you wont admit but its all in your head again

i wish it was easier
at least the musics good
and i know its late, ah

if you want to go just say
no end for me in sight
not sure how many more ways i can say
that youre the only thing i think about
but i feel it under conversation
oh, sometimes its not what its not
most times its not what its not
its not

some things just out of our control
theres nothing you could do
to make me think less of you

and i know
theres nothing i could do
to feel close enough to you
