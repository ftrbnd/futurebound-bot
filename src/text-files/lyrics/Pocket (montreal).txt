the zipper broke
now i cant open up my pocket
your guard is up
so were just shadowboxing
they called it lost
but i still feel it in there somewhere
but my hands are cold
you said then get out the snow
its not difficult

she said do i believe in angels
cant call it right now
cant rely on what i cant see
so why cant you tell me something
that doesnt feel like youre lying

but my zipper broke
and i cant op–µn up my pocket
i cant open up i know
its all
snow
snow
thats all
