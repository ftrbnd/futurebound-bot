its been a few years since you been gone
theres been a few tears but that was years and years ago
yeah i grew up to be exactly what you wanted
yeah i been living out the dream that you dreamt up

its been a few years with more to come
its been a few years since ive felt sure of what i want
and i woke up today and found that you were waiting here for me and i thought
woah, old friend its bittersweet

but how could you do this to me?
how could you do this to me?

cos you are not who you think you are
theres no grain on these brown eyes
but they can be green if they really want
and i can bend your words
so they say exactly what hurts the most
but silence is better than fake laughs
or faking were always up
loose grip
the world bends around you
and living through cracked screens
we fold down to what we want
out of love
we talk through lines
were made of smoke
and just in time
we drift away
diffusing light
confusing times
growing up
or cascading down?
cascading down
im hurting now

but change comes slow
if you hate whats in your head
the fuck would you speak your mind
in search of lost time
just 21 so im young and im stupid
only 16 yeah i think you shouldve known

i think you fucked me up

i think
i think you fucked me up
and ive got nothing to say to you

its been a few years and i moved on
couldnt make it disappear oh i tried so hard to be strong
but i grew up today and faced that im not just lonely
dont feel much better but i guess that its a start
