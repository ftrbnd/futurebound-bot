she said what you doing can you come through?
certain things i wish i could undo
dont want to feel a way, so let it pass through
waist pressed on you in a past life
she said undress her in the bathroom
give me head i love a good attitude
falling for you in a vacuum
slipping past 100 on the dash soon
when i call it, can you zoom?
comms check, one, two
i thought about you all of my night

found you outside
we had fun crimes
collapsed some time
ill cross your mind
call me next time
dilated eyes
quick death, brief life

crashing
crushing

i lost all focus
blurring thru these motions
you dont give a fuck since
distance turned to oceans
weaponise the timeline
ive been here in real life
dodging all these airstrikes
anxious but its alright
martyrdom weather

breaking in with your new friend
think of me when you shut it down

i read your message through the lines
i just want to cool it off
she just loves crossing all these wires
hands getting tied up in them
but dont you hate those cliches now
almost killed to not get stronger
the photos lasted longer
and after all this time were not much taller
i know

i lost all focus
blurring thru these motions
you dont give a fuck since
distance turned to oceans
weaponise the timeline
ive been here in real life
dodging all these airstrikes
anxious but its alright
martyrdom weather

breaking in with your new friend
think of me when you shut it down
fucking me out of your head
heart breaking were solo, ah
