shes in love with the concept
as if were all just how she imagined
cos were in love i just dont know it yet
well tell me how am i supposed to see the magic
cos i dont believe in it no more
but i wont tell her
cos i always imagined
its easier if she thinks she won
so imma let her

and she said
i dont think i love you no more
you never seem to call me lately
girl i dont think you know me at all
cos i never thought id have to say this
but i dont love you
and i never did look at us
burning down in flames for kicks
but just know
im not singing for your xo
im just singing cos its over

came and went like the summertime
was that a sunset or sunrise
looking back like whered the time go
so much for trying to keep this moving slow
cos i dont believe in her no more
but i remember

how we talked shit like we knew what we wanted
and i still remember what she said

i dont think i love you no more
you never seem to call me lately
but i dont think she knew me at all
cos i never thought id have to say this
but im no liar and i never hid anything
you shouldve seen it coming to this
just know
im not singing for an ex tho
im just singing cos its over
