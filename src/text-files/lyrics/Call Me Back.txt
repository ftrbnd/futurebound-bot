running on empty
i waited years in a past life
running out of rope and the waters high
i drowned for you and i didnt regret it
dont text me back in the afterlife
needed the time i didnt realise
i had it along, cant take my own advice
conflated filling the gaps for love

and its obvious
that im caved in and breaking up
but i know its good
i know its good
though its over now
in my dreams you call me back
but i hope you dont
i hope you dont

i hope youre gone and lost in better days
i been watching the time, how it erodes away
thinking bout how the last years feel like yesterdays
how did i lose grip on it?
honest
been falling through nightmares lightyears away
doing my best to keep those thoughts at bay
finding my highlights in the loudest places
and strangers faces 
getting caught up in the race of it

walking through the clearing crowd
if we took our chances
but we exchanged glances
call it in the moment
walking down the roads that i grew up on
falling out of habits
stopped bleeding for empathyâ€™s sake

and its obvious
that im caved in and breaking up
but i know its good
i know its good
though its over now
in my dreams you call me back
but i hope you dont
i hope you dont

cos i dont need you to tell me

that its ok im going
im searching
for what i am now
ill find you if its urgent
or if im hurting
more than i am now
and well come back here some day
and laugh about it
memories that dont know
how it felt like i was burning
while you werent watching
took everything i loved
now nowhere feels like home
nowhere feels like home

been a long life
still got mad time
took a wrong right
on it last time
through the long night
made it out alright
told my brother hold tight
sometimes i can feel it
sometimes i still
sometimes i feel
some times
