i wanted you to be the last thing on my mind
i wanted you to be the reason i close my eyes
but i cant sleep
and oh god i wanted to be your high
but everything i said went unheard
and everything you saw
with eyes straight blurred became our downfall

cos you say i drink
and i smoke and i talk too much
but i know you lied
when you said you just gotta go and save yourself
so hear me out

you know everybody talks girl
and it means nothing till you let it
but if you keep second guessing
then theres only gonna be one end

but you can leave if you really want to
and you can run if you feel you have to
now ill be fine if you ever ask me
i know it's hard but no one said its easy
fallings easy
but theres only one way up

so ive been thinking that i think too much
and i cant sleep but i can dream of us
and ive been seeing shit like horror cuts
its burning down i gotta drown this out

and you said you need me to let this go
but its who i am or am i just losing it
cos you said jump and i went first
but fallings always been my downfall

and you say i drink
and i smoke and i talk too much
but i know you lied
when you said that you just had enough and save yourself
so hear me out

you know everybody talks girl
and it means nothing til you let it
and if you keep second guessing
then theres only gonna be one end

but you can leave if you really want to
and you can run if you feel you have to
and i can drink if i feel i have to
i know its hard but  cant feel like i used to
like i used to

cos i used to defy gravity
defy gravity
goodbyes keep dragging me down
and im fighting gravity
defying gravity
i tried but i keep falling
cos fallings easy
but it only brings you down
