touch me and slip away
i cant hide feeling out of place
i cant function oh my mistake
thought you were someone i once knew
i was light-years ahead of me
thoughts in my head dont disappear
i was a maybe
that made you the truth
in time i will come
to see it for how
it really was
in my mind its only
false faces whisper
love you

if that feeling had a price
then i would gladly pay it
over and over and over til im broke
and if you held me for ransom
id love it id never want to go home
but all this hypothetical thinking
is digging me down
and maybe i was seconds away
but it doesnt matter now
heat death only seconds away
so no it dont matter now
