ten tonne
ballast on my chest 
as i woke up a heavy inhale 
for the nights you stole 
fucked up
the balance in my head 
but its all good 
ill see you again another dream

but i miss the way 
the sun streamed through my window 
and i miss the way 
you almost held the tide 
but still its nice 
thinking that youre somewhere 
feeling the same heat that i did 
another time 
if invisible lines lead your way back to me 
walk the line

i said id walk you home 
but we still went our own way 
the tears lost in rain 
on your cheekbones in silence 
and i pulled my head 
out the darkness in your house 
cant stay til the morning 
refracted my way out 
from nightmares in my car 
as i lay beside you 
and fucked up my timeline 
and twisted your end with 
so much still to go 
as the sun sets behind you 
i cant let it go 
you cant hold me 
i cant always

talk it out 
cut me off 
chalk it down 
to my head 
balancing my head 
slow it down 
rise and fall 
chalk it down 
to my head

and i miss the way 
the sun streamed through my window 
and i miss the way 
you almost held the tide 
but still its nice 
thinking that youre somewhere 
feeling the same heat that i did 
no fear no fall 
if invisible lines lead your way back to me 
still i got nothing

comme les nuits quand je ne savais pas encore 
comme les nuits qui m’ont appris à aimer les adieux 
comme les nuits quand on croyais que tout irais bien 
mais cela n’a pas d’importance car les nuits 
bruyantes//brilliantes 
sont toutes pareilles à la fin
