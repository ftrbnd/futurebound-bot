but where were going i don't know
i know its not the last time now
i cant seem to slow this bitch down
i dont want to talk about it

watch the time fly
moon rise
sun set
cold night
cold water
high tide
locked eyes
slow motion
soft focus
fade from me
lost on you
next time
stay with me
keep growing
cant fight it
losing time
brakes grinding
sliding
hard times
confiding
issa long way to go

but where we going i don't know
i know its not the last time now
but i hope this one my last time round
i just want to laugh about it

dont lose it now
