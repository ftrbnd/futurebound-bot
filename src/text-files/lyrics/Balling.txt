19 (baby!)
inverted baby
bright blue sky scenes
obscura in my bedroom
lying on the floor we had some times
bad ideas
soft spoken music to my ears
spending my money
like i wish i had spent time

but no our legacy sheets
can bring me sweet dreams
how strange is it when ours is lost in them
i said whenever you called id be there
i hope you never take advice from your friends
crammed in to the back seat of my first car
that i drove too fast
running from the thought i
know you dont get it when i say i been balling

its all bless
you couldnt stop crying i couldnt cry at all
how can i dance myself clean?
these rooms just dirty my soles
slowly my friends turned to places
i cant be everywhere at once
i watched some friends turn to places
now its just a one way convo

and til youre not afraid of going
ill be right here on your arm
and when its not my choice in staying
ill go

i know our legacy sheets
cant bring me sweet dreams
how strange is it when ours is lost in them
i said whenever you called id be there
i hope you never take advice from your friends
crammed in to the back seat of my first car
that i drove too fast
running from the thought i
know you dont get it when i tell you im balling

balling

we were just kids
you couldnt stop crying i couldnt cry at all
how can i dance myself clean?
these rooms just dirty my soles
slowly my friends turned to places
and i cant be everywhere at once
i watched some friends turn to places
now its just a one way convo
