i used to wonder how itd feel like
i looked to everyone for answers
chasing round and down in circles
on purpose
in search of something

i spent a while trying to learn somehow
some missing pieces will not stop me
tried to fill my gaps with heartbeats
so fleeting
but cold feet
im sorry

and i still dont know how i feel about it
and i still dont know but i feel like im learning
how to clear my head when all i think about is you
but im only human
i found out
i know now

i still wonder how id have turned out
if id done everything i wanted
if i had lived like i feel i couldve
or shouldve
when i was
younger
but im good now
i found out

that i still dont know how i feel about it
and i still dont know but i feel like im learning
how to catch my breath when all im breathing for is you
and i cant keep holding it down
but you keep showing me how
if youre only human
i think i found out
i think i know now

i used to wonder what love is
but ever since youve been around
i finally think i have it figured out
what i missed then
but see now
i found out
i know now
