my baby dont mess around
because she loves me so
and this i know for sure

but does she really wanna
but cant stand to see me
walk out the door

dont try to fight the feeling
cos the thought alone
is killing me right now

thank god for mom and dad
for sticking to together
cos we dont know how

hey ya

you think you got it
oh you think you got it
but got it just dont get it
when theres nothing at all

we get together
oh we get together
but separates always better
whens theres feelings involed

if what they say is nothing is forever
then what makes then what makes
then what makes love the exeception

so why
are we so in denial
when we know were not happy here?

hey ya

im too cool
im too cool for this
