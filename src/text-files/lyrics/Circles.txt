and if i told you how this story ends
would you change a step you take?
and if i could relive all of my days
id live them all the same

cos im scared
of all that i dont know
cos i want it all but all of it aint gold
and im scared
but i know its not for long
cos im learning what i shouldve long before

that all we are
is a light into the darkness
and all we are
is time thats counting down
and all we are
is falling through the spaces in between
endless flight

a lifetime in repeat

but i still find solace
when you say that you know how i feel
when its wrong
and we aint been right for years

let go
give these ghosts a new home
lets bury our pasts and our fears
and all these bones
and lets go
i shouldve seen it long before

cos this is my life
i will not run in circles
ending where i start

so hold on to me
well burn out slowly
and feel our hearts leap
to words we dont mean

love

means nothing to me
cos i dont know what it is
im just dying to be
all that ive been dreaming of
and words betray me
contradict all i stand for
but im still learning
yeah im still learning

that all we are
is a light into the darkness
and oh we are
just time thats counting down
and all we are
is falling through the spaces in between
endless flight

were falling to our knees
