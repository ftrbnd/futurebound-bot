i was looking for your face in the prequels
that keep running through my mind when its idle
i know you never had the time for my sci-fis
but you loved shape shifting
i know we were high but i meant it
im not trying to fuck about, if it looks it
i told her now is not the time im just dancing
and ghost erasing

but i remember
that sunset like it was last night
fireworks blowing holes in the night sky
she told me baby now or never
didnt know what it was for a long time
but it was you for so long on my mind
i know were breaking but

i just want to hear your voice in the morning
cos i been up waiting for something thats hopeless
i dont really want to break your heart when its open
like finding out loves not a feeling
its a choice

you want me to tell you
ive always hated dancing
but i would dance with you
but i can see right through you babe
know youd love me if i told you
that im in love with you

but i remember
that sunset like it was last night
fireworks blowing holes in the night sky
she told me baby now or never
didnt know how to feel for a long time
but it was you for so long on my mind
i know its breaking but

i just want to hear your voice in the morning
cos i been up waiting for something thats hopeless
i dont really want to break your heart when its open
like finding out loves not a feeling
its a choice
