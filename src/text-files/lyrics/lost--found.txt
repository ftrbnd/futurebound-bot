i think i lost myself out
somewhere in between
finding out who i am
confusing that with what i dream
and it feels like everyones done waiting
so what am i supposed to do?
when i can feel these bridges breaking
and im drifting further from you
from you
but oh
let it go

cos i found god
and he said plans change a lot
and so if i can help my luck
then things wont go the way theyre going
and i wont lose home and i wont lose courage
and wont fade to gold
or worse a shadow

cos if everyone is gone i dont wanna be here
i dont wanne be left alone
