how do i say
all i want just falls away
i dont know how to 
keep us in time 
mind is changing
all you want so far is 
love, death and some kind of higher high 
youre reaching
and if were all just drifting by 
phones in the air 
face to the sky 
and all this time to realise 
theres nothing stopping you 
from leaving

please dont go 
drifter

what do i say 
all that time just thrown away 
i dont know how to 
keep lives apart 
theyre bleeding 
mind is racing 
all you want so far is 
love, death and some kind of higher high 
youre reaching 
and if were all just drifting by 
phones in the air 
face to the sky 
all this time to realise 
nothing stopping you 
from leaving me

please dont go 
drifter
