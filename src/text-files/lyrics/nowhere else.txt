youve been confusing since the day i met you
another night chasing this feels like home
since ive been miles away no change
outside or inside looking dazed
just wash the glitter off your face and go home

winter sun throwing shadows long and lonesome
how strange to think that we were strangers once
at square one i guess its all me you want more than i got
but i cant ask you for the things you dont feel
dont

cos i dont want no fake love
i dont wanna know no fake friends forced smiles or favours
and i dont wanna know no fake love
just say what you wanna say
and ill still be there
its easy when youve nothing to lose

and ill still be there
cos ive got nowhere else
she told me love me fast but take it slow

i said im going nowhere fast as hell
and keeping with the times we gotta keep in on the low
midnight habits burning through the summer since the snow and
i finally feel myself again
its been so long i thought id seen the end
but i guess you need ends to begin again
and again

cos this is nothing we aint seen before
i lived through it i aint overdosed
the sky is falling like it always does
so i guess well see if someones watching over us
so let it rain
the clouds look heavy but they bear no weight
the scars cant hurt you and the bruises will fade

and i dont want no fake love
i dont wanna know no fake friends forced smiles or favours
and i dont wanna know no fake love
just say what you wanna say

and ill still be there
its easy when youve nothing to lose
and ill still be there
cos ive got nowhere else

and i dont want no fake love
i dont wanna know no fake friends forced smiles or favours
and i dont wanna know no fake love
just say what you wanna say
