tide rushing in to me
two me
till i can breath easy on my knees
comes falling sins
ive been
living easy on my knees
on my

concaving in the back
days slipping through the cracks
call for you in the back
ill become stoic if i have to
royce rolling in the back
no phone is now a lux
heartbreaking in the past on me
on me
the still life projections of you
diffracting through my skull till

tide rushing in to me
two me
till i can breath easy on my knees
comes falling sense
ive been
living easy on my knees
breath easy on me
sleep easy on me
