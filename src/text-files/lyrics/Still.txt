im only mad cos i love you
cant make you see it my way
been trying to do the right thing
im only sad cos i dont want to watch it

all fall apart
under the skin
into my arms
love at what cost
eyes full of tears
aim for the heart
head in the dark
how was i supposed to know
the love i was chasing
was bleeding me out

and airing my calls
how i made it out boy
heaven only knows
but i was somebody
ive been here before
cos we want what we want
but its never enough
til its gone

i just want to let you know
its still love even though
i think of the end just to ease my mind
baby dont stress, happens all the time
i just want to feel the rush 
its still love after all
and i think about death and it frees my mind
i still dont want to watch it 
all fall apart

so wake me up before you go
arms around eachother
for a moment we were god
starlight in the morning
i had everything I want
be dragged or let go
guess wed all die for something

that wont die for us
and why im still standing
heaven only knows
but i was somebody
ive been here before
cos we want what we want
but its never enough til its gone

i just want to let you know
its still love even though
i think of the end just to ease my mind
baby dont stress, happens all the time
i just want to feel the rush 
its still love after all
and i think about death and it frees my mind

i know its dark but it helps
i know its dark but it helps
i know its dark but it helps
i know its dark but it helps

i know its dark but its hell

i know its dark but it helps
