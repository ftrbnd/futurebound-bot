you try to kill it but it wont stop bleeding
try to forget it but it wont stop killing you
youre running out of time
yeah you know you cant go back
its too late
to say its too late
you cant take back that you said nothing
how could you do nothing

is this burning right?
am i living bridges
can we build our past right?
learning through future solecism

its played out (ive missed times)
ive moved on (been disconnected)
get fucked up (i stressed time)
my new draw (forgetting timing)
and its not right (and i need you to talk me down)
youre dead wrong
what are we doing (cos i feel like i need to crash)
lets go home
theres no hope
its all wrong

//cos i been looking at the sky to show me where i went wrong
//been looking at the sky like someone was looking down
//but it keeps raining on me
//and i been looking at the sky since i was like 5 years old
//been looking for the the stars but it seems like theyre all gone
//and the faults not ours alone
//but i think its time to go

its played out
ive moved on
get fucked up
my new draw
and its not right
youre dead wrong
what are we doing?
lets go home
theres no hope
its all wrong

and ive got way too many questions just to try and get it right
cos i cant be the one to shrug it off
and i could be the reason that we stay up all night to be someone
be someone
and oh all weve got is to try to get it right
but no one told you
that this gon hurt
oh no
and now all i really want is to scream

that shit just to try and find a way get my head down
and head out or maybe just the two of us
and head now
im just trying to find the real now
dream clouds, ghost ground
real friends, dead home town

cos i been looking at the sky to show me where i went wrong
been looking at the sky like someone was looking down
but it keeps raining on me
when i been looking at the sky since i was like 5 years old
been looking for the the stars but it seems like theyre all gone
and it breaks my heart you know
but i think its time to go

//and its not right
//youre dead wrong
//what are we doing
//lets go home
//theres no hope
//its all wrong
