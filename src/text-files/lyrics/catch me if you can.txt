of course im scared
would i be thinking straight if i wasnt
of course im scared sometimes
even if i say it dont phase me
or if i say im not hazy

cos drowning aint so bad
cos at least you know where youre going
but were all futurebound
so i guess thats really the same thing

but i always liked the thought of maybe being a runaway
i could be your lover and you could be my heartache
and i could sing the songs that we used to sing when we were kids
maybe that could take us back to before we got stuck in this

i want to be like john dillinger
just try to catch me if you can
and we could drive off in the sunset
even if its not the plan

cos plans are overrated
cos you never really know where youre going
and the past is always changing
aint been gold since i remembered it that way

but i always liked the thought of maybe being a runaway
i could be your lover and you could be my heart ache
and i could could sing the songs that we used to sing way back when
the future wasnt everything
we lived because we loved it then
oh im going back
catch me if you can
