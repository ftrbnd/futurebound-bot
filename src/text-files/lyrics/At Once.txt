just want you to know
the feelings mutual
wherever you may go
just know youre not alone

i just want you to know
the feelings mutual
wherever you may go
youre never on your own

i just want you to know
the feelings mutual
wherever you may go
youre never on your own 

how could i let you down
were already six feet under
how could i let you down
were already six feet under

i just want you to know 
though feelings come and go
a song is only just
so many different waves
it happened all at once
entangled particles
from when i held you close
some things never change
you know youre not alone

i just want you to know 
the feelings mutual 
wherever you may go 
just know youre not alone

i just want you to know
the feelings mutual 
wherever you may go 
youre never on your own

i just want you to know 
the feelings mutual
wherever you may go
youre never own your own

i just want you to know 
the feelings mutual
wherever you may go
youre never on your own
