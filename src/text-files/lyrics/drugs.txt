cos i had the best of the worst sides
and i had these lungs
and i had too many flash fires
that i just let them burn

till my chest is on fire
and my head just wont die
i guess im lying cos i wanna
i guess im lying cos i dont
cos i just feel so tired
like its move or slowly die
you aint you when youre like this
this aint you and you know it
but aint that just the point

you dont know
how to let go
who said this must be all or nothing
but im
still caught below
and ill never let you know
no i cant tell you nothing

cos im a fucking mess sometimes
but still i could always be
whatever you wanted
but not what you needed
especially when you been needing me
cos im a fucking mess sometimes
and ill say what i dont mean
just cos i wanted
or maybe i need it
swear lyings the only rush i need

cos all i needed was some words to say
that all these feelings dont mean shit to me
cos its all just chemicals anyway
anyway
and i got way to many routes to take
to make this all just go away
and find another heart to break
so heartless with the words i say
just saying what im supposed to say
cos i had nothing for you
i cant love when i cant even love myself
things i would rather be thoughts at the back of my head but im addicted to hurting
and i got these lungs
and I spent too many late nights
thinking a hole in the earth

till the sky is on fire
and my head still wont die
i guess im lying cos i want to
i guess im lying cos i dont
cos i just feel so tired
like i need something to come alive
she said you aint you when youre like this
this aint you what you done?
and i said thats the point

you dont know how to let go
who said this must be all or nothing
but im still caught bellow
and ill never let you know
no i cant tell you nothing

cos im a fucking mess sometimes
but still i could always be
whatever you wanted
but not what you needed
especially when you been needing me
cos im a fucking mess inside
and ill say what i dont mean
just cos i wanted
or maybe i need it
swear lyings the only rush i need
