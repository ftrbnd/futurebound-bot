and i said whats up
what you been thinking
cos you been staring at that roof so long id swear its come alive
and she spoke nine words
and now were sinking
but i cant find it in myself to want to lie to keep this thing from going down

cos that girl took my heart
and i aint want it back
no
im laying down my cards

cos you said it meant nothing
and i shouldve kept my silence
but i guess im too attached to my own pride to let you know
that all these words meant nothing
and ive always been this heartless
and we were just having sex no i would never call it love
but love

oh no i think im catching feelings and i
dont know if this is empathy i feel just
hold on remember why you said this was the last time
woah
so i guess its
let die to let live

and whats good
when both choices ive got
have us staring down the barrel
to the bullets i cant stop
and so i stand off
like indecisions kevlar
till this fear of feeling stops and im done
but you

no i dont know how to forget you

cos that girl took my heart
and i aint want it back no
a bulletproof restart

oh no i think im catching feelings and i
dont know if this is empathy i feel just
hold on remember why you said this was the last time
woah
so i guess its
let die to let live

no i dont know how to forget you

/i am done feeling
