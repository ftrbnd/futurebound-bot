boy i feel elusive
falling loose

looking down the line 
got so much to show you
i know that sometimes
some things not for me
i know what I want
and it keeps me lonely

writing in all caps 
trying to make it mean something
feeling will come back
let it weigh down on you
elysian facades
keep my hands up
holyfields
come and see how comfort kills 
interlinked dont want much else
just trying to live like august feels
feel

unchecked growth like cancer cells

sometimes I wish
that i was somebody else

true love , true love 
no rush , no rush
no whys , no why's
just cos , just cos
just cos , just cos

youre not looking
and still seeing something
part of me knows nothing
i could hear could be enough
to make me feel something I dont

true love is true love 
no rush , no rush
no whys , no why's
just cos , just cos
just cause , just cause
