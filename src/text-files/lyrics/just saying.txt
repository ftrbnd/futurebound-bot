honestly i cant sleep no more
on film its dark but its only reconstructing
light that dont shine no more

cant help but
dream of nights i cant live no more
feelings die and she dont sleep in my arms no more

but ill get right in a little bit
ill find my light in the little bits
passed out on my bedroom floor
ill get back up
i lost my mind when i needed it
yeah its so sad
what we had
was never enough for us
just echoes and dust

just saying if you want it go find it

yeah
self division in the dark
you were a multi coloured vision
versions of another version fell apart
high speed
halide lifting silver linings from the dark
and its just starting to sink in
i ran through the morning
when the light showed me nothing
i didnt know before

so close but you say were better off
leave the curtains drawn
i dont think you understand
how were splitting the loop
a last impression of you
i left some time ago
so how you gon catch me now?
these waves just keep ringing out

so slowly
i watched it burn
so slowly
all the things that we love tie us up

just echoing slowly

i watched it burn
so slowly
all the things that we love turn on us

but ill get right in a little bit
ill find my light in the little bits
passed out on my bedroom floor
ill get back up, get back up
lost my mind when i needed it
yeah its so sad
but what we had
was never enough for us
just echoes and dust

just saying if you want it go find it

how fast the light died out
we lost track of ourselves
riding the wave
at last the time of our lives
waited for us
dont you lost it now
dont you lose me now
