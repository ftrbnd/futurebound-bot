i saw the northern lights at 19
pathfinding in the sky and staying up like that shit easy
feeling i might call and make a mill just like its easy
why should i save a world that would never save me?
and ive been burning both ends
like im trying to see the end of time
fucking like we fell in love with wasted life
what you waiting for?
we wont always feel this good

waiting for?
yeah
how would the right time grant what you want?
dont you want to feel right standing on your ones?
on your ones

its just how i feel some times
i told you its gon be alright
but i only hear about you thru friends now
i didnt feel the time slip by
i didnt know that was a last goodbye
i guess we are who we are til were not

and with my arms round my friends
til the bitter end
i dont really care
what you really said
i can break my heart by myself 
guess we are who we are til were not
if it keeps going how its been then were gone
and if its all in my head
i made peace with it
im still myself in the morning
i been waking up with a new friend
and they boyfriend and his new friends
 
so what you waiting for?
build me up, i cant feel this enough
called your bluff, i dont care if you walk this time

but its just how i feel some times
i told you its gon be alright
i only hear about you thru friends now

i didnt feel the time slip by
i didnt know that was a last goodbye
i guess we are who are til were not

its just how i feel some times
i told you we gon be alright
but i only hear about you thru friends now

i didnt feel the time slip by
didnt know that was a last goodbye
guess we are who are til were not
and i dont wanna feel like im reaching
i dont want it
