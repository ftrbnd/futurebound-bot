at least you cut me off slow
your game gets heavy when my mind run
i saw your ghost in new york
was lookin for you on my shoulder

its crazy
i told you i was such a try hard
knew it was never gonna last long
calling you up you let me ring out
nonstop

you can only get part of what you want
i hear the disappointment seeping through the way you talk
and i was biding time i shouldve held you in my arms
tryna reach above for higher levels but theyre locked

it dont have to be this hard
sabotage myself in style
its so bittersweet when crushed
so im keepin my feelings locked
