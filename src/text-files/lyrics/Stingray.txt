i got a feeling last night
you were on your way over
walking the line of the cracks in the road
if i had thought to read the signs
i couldve maybe bought time
but now you keep your leaking eyes to the floor
collider feel
im running keep my lines on track
and pushing through
said youd never come back

but dont you want to watch it die?
collapse in for you now
im pulling the time back
i just want to watch it die
cant stop now anyway
cant shake the thought of
when i close my eyes youre

walking out the door
i still see you
know you needed something more
i see you you see through me
walking out the door
i wish you said it to me
know you needed something more

i just wanna watch it die
cant stop now anyway
cant shake this thought of
when i close my eyes youre

walking out the door
i still see you
know you needed something more
i see you you see through me
walking out the door
i wish you said it to me
know you needed something more 
i wish you said it to me

dont you want to watch it die?
collapse in for you now
im pulling the time back
i just want to watch it die
cant stop now anyway
cant shake the thought of
when i close my eyes youre
