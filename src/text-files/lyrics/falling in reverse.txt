so listen here im the voice in your head
and i can say the words that make you feel scared
so heres to you and all the problems that weve made
and i know its so hard to stay afloat when you make monsters out of thoughts
and youre dragged under
and everyone around you is too far away to notice your chest start to crush
but its alright
oh youll be alright

so just breathe
its almost over
and dont let the monster in your head
become your fears
cos you can save yourself you know

you know
so listen here i know its hard
maybe i cant be what you want
but im just who i am and trying to be what you could need
and i am still here that voice in your head
and ill be there for you when no one else cares
and this is it as far as where weve got since then
so know a good thing when you got it
and i hope you know
you dont go alone
