and this is just another sad song
cant deny that ive been needing one
and that the world is always at fault
and we did nothing how did we do wrong
and ive been thinking that when we thought
the world would break us that we werent wrong
but its just never been the world outside
and sonder kinda has me terrified
and im so sorry i cant find the time
spend all my days over preoccupied
and ive been thinking bout how id react
if you were me and i was ghosted out
and i know i should try more
but ive been so caught in my own small shit that i cant see
past the nothing around me
but ive been trying really fucking hard not to try so hard
really fucking hard to just let go
really fucking hard not to try so hard
and realise ive nowhere left to go

/and playing it safe.
