i dont
follows
fighting
for a
lost cause
feel like
even
drifting
were just
off course

or is it no good?
what are we if dying for?
what are we lying for?
oh if its no good?
what would you call it?

mind if
i dont
end this
dying
if its
worth it
you would
know

oh it stops
all the faking its all fire
no flame can absolve sin
but its no thing
ill get sullen
when i get sober
despite my best
you keep calling

you got something i dont want to miss out on
i dont leave you over your stead
would you call that love?
you call that love?
would you call that love?
all that love
