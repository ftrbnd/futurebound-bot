so this is how i die now
hands to the air
no they cant stop that sky falling down
guess i thought that id feel good somehow
when all you know is up its hard not to feel like
you aint going down

disappearing through the silence
screams fade and blur
conversating with a smile though
life invisible
guess i thought that id feel better now
somehow
any how
so now

icarus
no i cant escape this fall
falling in reverse
falling in reverse

so how you gonna scream my name
when i gave all i got
ive nothing left to give you
cos im so burnt out and lost
cos it all just feels the same
and i got all i want
i had you where i wanted
i guess i dont know
how to live with a good thing
and not break it into nothing
self destruct just to feel

or so it goes

so tell me how you want me here now
keep crying down the phone
yeah thats all i seem to hear now
keep lying through your teeth
lie to me
lie with me now

so tell me how you really feel now
aint been asked that in a while
yet you still hope that theyll hear you out
just keep at it bro these things always seem to fix themselves somehow
suck it up some would kill just to stand where youre standing now

icarus
no i cant escape this fall
falling in reverse
crash landing for thrills

so how you gonna scream my name
when i gave all i got
ive nothing left to give you
cos im so burnt out and lost
cos fuck it it all feels the same
and i got all i want
i thought that id feel something
guess ill never know
how to live with a good thing
fucked up my life for nothing, nothing
cos you dont care if im still bleeding
you just scream until you hear my name

so this is how i die now
hands to the air
no they cant stop that sky falling down
guess i thought that id feel good somehow
disappearing through the silence
screams fade and blur
conversating with a smile though
life invisible
guess i thought that id feel better now
somehow
any how
by now
