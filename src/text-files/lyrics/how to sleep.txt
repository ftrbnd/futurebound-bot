i dont think i kn-
that i felt like i knew what i was doing
but i dont really
remember feeling very scared about it

the water was cool and youre shining
the windows were burning patterns in my mind
running away was so tiring
holding your stare
i felt miles behind
how do you love when youre frightened?
the thought of me fucking up all these threads
situations i know are just passing
im holding on for you

and static feel
the light ran down the wall
holding back the stars
dividing us in new ways
away from sleep
confusion has its cost
wavepools in the dark
crashing round my head

i dont think there was like a happiest time
i feel like there are happy moments

the water was cool and youre shining
the windows were burning patterns in my mind
and running away was so tiring
holding your stare
i slip miles behind
how do you love when youre frightened?
the thought of me fucking up all these threads
situations i know are just passing
im holding on for you

and how to sleep
the light ran down the wall
holding back the stars
dividing us in new ways
away from sleep
confusion has its cost
wavepools in the dark
crashing round my head
