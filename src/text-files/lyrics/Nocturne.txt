so ive been thinking bout something
lately ive been alive
cos i found my reason in nothing
so i wont close my eyes
cos i dont want to miss one second
and i dont want to feel so cold
and i dont want to be so sad that we are who we are
cos we had no control

but only by the night
will we ever make headlines
will we ever make things right
when weve only ourselves to blame
when weve only ourselves to blame

so i wont sleep no more
no i wont sleep no more
i wont sleep
i always thought that thered be more than just wishing my life away
like i could always
figure it out and never have to abandon whats in front of me
dream no more

so get this doubt out of my head
its only real if you let it
and ive been letting go of my ghosts
ill never let them catch me no more
but these words are all i have so ill just keep dreaming out loud
and if i just keep talking maybe ill figure all of this out

but only by the night
will we ever make headlines
will we ever make things right
when weve only ourselves to blame
and weve only ourselves to blame

so i wont sleep no more
no i wont sleep no more
no i wont sleep no more
i always thought that thered be more than just wishing my life away
like i could always
figure it out and never have to abandon whats in front of me
dream no more
