lord knows were wrong
ceilings were floors
that we clipped our lives through
but im closer to hope
now downs become up
i can see the light skew

but its alright, i wont be long
drilla come thru and try snatch my phone
inside out, comme des garcons
no bad blood, i dont hold a grudge
girls still try but i let it go
proud of my tears, proud to be alone
proud of my highs
proud of my lows
and though some of these things
just out of our control i

i know you think about me sometimes
i hope he treats you like you always wanted
in time these rushes we feel wont fly by
how can i think ahead youre always on my mind?
how can i think ahead youre always

hate feeling like this
thinking in crises
feeling so cliche
ooh
tried to run from it
she said im not above it
im from it
ooh

cos you were looking at me back like that
rushing thru the years trying to turn the clock back
i cant always be there
but i you know i come back
i been racing
and been in last for so long

but its alright, i wont be long
drilla come thru and try snatch my phone
inside out, comme des garcons
no bad blood, i dont hold a grudge
girls still try but i let it go
proud of my tears and proud to be alone
proud of my highs
and proud of my lows
and though some of these things
just out of our control ive

i know you think about me sometimes
i hope he treats you like you always wanted
in time these rushes we feel wont fly by
how can i think ahead youre always on my mind?
how can i think ahead youre all thats on my mind?
every sight
