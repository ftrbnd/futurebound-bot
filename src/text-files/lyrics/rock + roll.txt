so tell me this is who you are
they tell me ive got something more
and oh you could be loved
but i dont want the lights to find me when im dark and lost
but never on my own

cos i just wanna swing like sinatra
singing like i cant stop
cos i could never rock like a rolling stone
i just wanna live like the ones before
and maybe i could play guitar like hendrix
or save the world or end it
and then maybe youll remember me when im gone
thats all i could ever want
thats all i want

so i got ten minutes to be all or nothing to
whoever wants to hear
and i got ten weeks of talking bullshit on repeat till im burnt out and disappear
but i owe you nothing
and i own my luck
oh they said youll never be alone again
but i dont think you understand me or what i fear
but you could be loved
but i dont want to lie to tell myself
im more than all the mistakes ive out run

cos im only here for a minute
and i dont care what you say cos i know
youre only here cos im winning
but i can be my own kind of rock and roll like
i dont really care if you say you dont fuck with me
and i can say what the fuck i want cos its down to me
and i got love for you even if you are doubting me
like oh my god i just cant stop

cos i just wanna sing like sinatra
with ethanol my soundtrack
cos i could never rock like a rolling stone
i wonder how it feels to burn out young
cos i just wanna die before my heart fails
from heartbreak or cocktails and
then maybe youll cry once you know im gone
thats all i could ever want
oh thats all i want

cos i aint scared of living
i aint scared of living
no i aint scared of living
cos its all weve got
what are we breathing for if we aint living
and i dont want your love
i just want to feel like im still living
and if there is no god
ill know the day i die i lived through heaven
and that i gave it hell
and if it hurt oh well at least thats living

thats all i want

sex drugs and rock and roll thats all i want
whats under the words you know thats all i want
something more than superficial is all i want
sex drugs and rock and roll thats all i want

/i aint scared of living.
